### Handwriting Recognition Neural Network 

For my final year project, I researched the mathematics of image processing and recognition. Focussing on the topic of neural networks and gradient descent to perform supervised learning, I developed a [simple perceptron network](https://github.com/AdelaideBaron/Simple-Neural-Network) using machine learning. 

I began developing a more advanced neural network of four layers, however, due to lack of C++ experience and time I was unable to complete this. Now that I have a better understanding of OOP coding, I am refactoring and completing the code. 

A WIP, I have set a deadline of 01 September 2022.

Current work: 
- creating layer and node objects. 
- Beginning with 2x2 mock image inputs. 
- Designing adhering to the SOLID principles, so that I can adapt to using 28 x 28 images (from the MNIST database). 

_report to be linked at the beginning of August 2022, once undergraduate grades and marking confirmed_.
